#Fedup 
It all started when I had to come up with a task management system for my work. I just could not find a decent minimal task management system which was open-sourced. Thus Fedup! Currently the project has two apps: tasks and leave. Tasks manages tasks for members in your team. And leave is used to track your leave of absence.

Fedup is built in Python using Django as the framework.

###Installation

You need Python and Django installed in your system.

There should be no other dependencies. To start the server:

    python manage.py runserver

This will start a server in your local machine on the port 8000.
